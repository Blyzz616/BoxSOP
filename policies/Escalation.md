#### Scope
This policy applies to all employees of Box Manufacturing and outlines the procedures for escalating cybersecurity issues, incidents, or concerns within the organization to ensure prompt resolution and effective management of cybersecurity risks.

#### Audience
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party partners of Box Manufacturing who encounter cybersecurity incidents or concerns that require escalation for resolution.

#### Escalation Process
1. **Initial Assessment**: When an employee detects or suspects a cybersecurity issue, they must conduct an initial assessment to evaluate the severity and potential impact of the incident. If the issue cannot be resolved independently or requires escalation based on predefined criteria, it should be escalated promptly to the appropriate personnel or team.

2. **Tiered Escalation Levels**: Box Manufacturing employs a tiered escalation approach based on the severity and complexity of cybersecurity incidents:
   - **Tier 1**: Initial Incident Response - Handled by frontline employees or designated cybersecurity responders. Includes basic troubleshooting and containment efforts.
   - **Tier 2**: Advanced Incident Handling - Managed by experienced cybersecurity analysts or incident response team members. Involves in-depth analysis, investigation, and mitigation measures.
   - **Tier 3**: Executive or Specialized Escalation - Reserved for critical incidents requiring executive-level involvement or specialized expertise from external resources.

3. **Notification Channels**: Employees should utilize designated communication channels for reporting cybersecurity incidents based on the severity and urgency of the situation. These channels may include:
   - Direct reporting to the IT Security team or designated cybersecurity point of contact.
   - Incident reporting platforms or ticketing systems for logging and tracking incidents.
   - Emergency communication channels for immediate response to critical incidents outside regular business hours.

### Communication Protocols
Employees must report cybersecurity incidents or concerns promptly using predefined reporting protocols. It is essential to maintain detailed documentation of incidents, including affected systems and initial response actions. There should be communication between IT, the incident response team, and any relevant business units to aid in efficient incident resolution.

### Follow-Up and Resolution
Box Manufacturing maintains an incident response plan outlining procedures for escalating, investigating, and resolving cybersecurity incidents. Employees involved in incident response activities must adhere to the guidelines outlined in the incident response plan. After resolving a cybersecurity incident, a post-incident review should be conducted to evaluate response effectiveness and implement corrective actions.

### Compliance and Accountability
Employees are expected to comply with this cybersecurity escalation policy and follow the prescribed escalation process. Managers and designated cybersecurity personnel are responsible for overseeing the escalation process within their areas and ensuring prompt and effective incident resolution.

### Training and Awareness
All employees must undergo regular cybersecurity awareness training to familiarize themselves with best practices, incident reporting procedures, and escalation protocols. Periodic incident response drills should be conducted to test readiness and validate the effectiveness of the escalation process.

### Review and Continuous Improvement
This cybersecurity escalation policy will be periodically reviewed to assess effectiveness, relevance, and alignment with industry standards. Feedback from employees and stakeholders will be solicited to identify areas for improvement and enhance incident response capabilities.
