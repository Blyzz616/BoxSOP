#### Audience
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party partners of Box Manufacturing who encounter cybersecurity incidents or concerns that require escalation for resolution.

#### Escalation Process
1. **Initial Assessment**: When an employee detects or suspects a cybersecurity issue, they must conduct an initial assessment to evaluate the severity and potential impact of the incident. If the issue cannot be resolved independently or requires escalation based on predefined criteria, it should be escalated promptly to the appropriate personnel or team.

2. **Tiered Escalation Levels**: Box Manufacturing employs a tiered escalation approach based on the severity and complexity of cybersecurity incidents:
   - **Tier 1**: Initial Incident Response - Handled by frontline employees or designated cybersecurity responders. Includes basic troubleshooting and containment efforts.
   - **Tier 2**: Advanced Incident Handling - Managed by experienced cybersecurity analysts or incident response team members. Involves in-depth analysis, investigation, and mitigation measures.
   - **Tier 3**: Executive or Specialized Escalation - Reserved for critical incidents requiring executive-level involvement or specialized expertise from external resources.

3. **Notification Channels**: Employees should utilize designated communication channels for reporting cybersecurity incidents based on the severity and urgency of the situation. These channels may include:
   - Direct reporting to the IT Security team or designated cybersecurity point of contact.
   - Incident reporting platforms or ticketing systems for logging and tracking incidents.
   - Emergency communication channels for immediate response to critical incidents outside regular business hours.

#### Communication Protocols
- **Timely Reporting**: Employees must promptly report cybersecurity incidents or concerns to the appropriate escalation level following predefined reporting protocols.
- **Clear Documentation**: Detailed documentation of incidents, including the nature of the incident, affected systems, and initial response actions, should be recorded in incident reports or incident management systems.
