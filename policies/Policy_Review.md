### Scope
This policy applies to all employees of Box Manufacturing and outlines the procedures for the review and updating of company policies to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

### Audience
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and representatives of Box Manufacturing who are involved in the creation, maintenance, or implementation of company policies.

### Policy Review
It is the responsibility of the policy owner, assigned by the management team, to review the assigned policy on an annual basis. The policy owner should assess the effectiveness, relevance, and compliance of the policy with current laws, regulations, and industry standards.

Upon completion of the review, the policy owner must submit a report detailing any recommended changes, updates, or revisions to the policy to the designated policy approval authority.

### Policy Updating
If the policy approval authority approves the recommended changes, updates, or revisions, the policy owner must implement the approved modifications within one month unless other circumstances prohibit that change. If there are circumstances preventing the implementation of the change, then those circumstances need to be documented and relayed to the policy approval authority, and a new updated timeframe needs to be implemented.

Once the updates are made, the revised policy should be communicated to all employees to which that policy applies to ensure awareness and compliance.

### Documentation
All changes, updates, and revisions made to a policy must be documented and maintained in the official policy repository. This documentation should include the date of the review, the rationale for the changes, and the approval status of the updated policy.

Employees are expected to adhere to the established review and updating processes to uphold the integrity and effectiveness of Box Manufacturing policies.
