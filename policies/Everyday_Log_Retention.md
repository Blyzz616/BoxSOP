### Scope
This policy applies to all employees of Box Manufacturing who handle sensitive data, governing the retention of logs created during daily operations to ensure security and compliance.

### Audience
This policy is applicable to all employees, contractors, and vendors who have access to Box Manufacturing's information systems and data.

### Retention Period
Logs containing information such as system events and user activities must be retained for a minimum period of eighteen months from the date of creation.

Any suspicious activities detected in the logs must be reported immediately to the IT Security team for investigation and remediation.

### Backup and Storage
All logs must be regularly backed up and stored in a secure location to prevent data loss or tampering. Backups should be tested at least once every two weeks to ensure they are complete and accurate.

Physical log storage devices must be kept in a secure environment with restricted access to authorized personnel only.

### Disposal of Logs
At the end of the retention period, logs must be securely disposed of to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.
Logs should be either shredded or permanently deleted using secure erasure methods.

Any disposal of logs must be documented and approved by the IT Security team to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
